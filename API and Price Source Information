The plan is to support high volume coins, and possibly some others. 
To accurately pin a price on the price of bitcoin, we'll use multiple sources for the USD/BTC price.
From each source, the last trade will be determined as the price of the currency on the exchange as it shows what price the units are being sold and purchased at.


To ensure the BTC/USD price is accurate, we must use a large amount of exchange to grab information from.

To calculate individual exchange price and the final price, 

	btcusd_prices = {
		    "poloniexBTC_USDT": #,
		    "geminiBTCUSD": #,
		    "okcoinBTCUSD": #,
		    "bitfinexBTCUSD": #,
		    "btceBTCUSD": #,
		    "krakenBTCUSD": (#,
		    "bitstampBTCUSD": #
		}
	
	def get_BTCUSD(btcusd_prices):
		usdpw_usdtotal = 0
		for price in btcusd_prices.values():
			usdpw_usdtotal += price
		usdpw_BTCUSD = usdpw_usdtotal / len(btcusd_prices)
		return usdpw_BTCUSD

We'll use the same API and code from these websites for large coins such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Ripple, and more if they support it. 




If there are coins without a $COIN/USD trade, then the price of the coin will have to be determined by this calculation.

exchangeCOINUSD = exchangeCOINBTC * usdpw_BTCUSD 

* usdpw_BTCUSD will be the main/average pricepoint calculated from all the exchanges. (See above)


An example of this being used, XMR/USD

	1 poloniexXMRBTC = 0.01795 BTC
	1 BTC = $600 USD
	
	poloniexXMRUSD = 0.01795 * 600
	=> 10.77

The price of 1 XMR is 0.01795 BTC or $10.77 USD.

*poloniexXMRUSD is the variable for the LAST trade on that market pair.

The plan is to support high volume coins, and possibly some others. 
To accurately pin a price on the price of bitcoin, we'll use multiple sources for the USD/BTC price.
From each source, the price will be determined with (bid + ask) / 2, as that way, it's a rough, but accurate estimate of the price as it meets between the price people are willing to pay for, as well as the price that people are selling at.
This rule and way of calculation should only be done with BTC/USD or other high volume, low spread coins as it's extremely innacurate for low priced currencies.

To ensure the BTC/USD price is accurate, we must use a large amount of exchange to grab information from.

We'll use the same API from these websites for large coins such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Ripple, and more if they support it. 
If they don't, we'll only use a handful of those exchanges to calculate the price.

If there are coins without a $COIN/USD trade, then the price of the coin will have to be determined by this calculation.

exchangeCOINBTC_mid = (exchangeCOINBTC_ask + exchangeCOINBTC_bid) / 2
exchangeCOINUSD = exchangeCOINBTC_mid * usdpw_BTCUSD 

* usdpw_BTCUSD will be the main/average pricepoint calculated from all the exchanges. (See below)


An example of this being used, XMR/USD

	1 XMR_ask = 0.018 BTC
	1 XMR_ask = 0.0179 BTC
	1 BTC = $600 USD
	
	poloniexXMRBTC_mid = (0.018 + 0.0179) / 2
	=> 0.01795
	
	poloniexXMRUSD = 0.01795 * 600
	=> 10.77

The price of 1 XMR is 0.01795 BTC or $10.77 USD.















To calculate individual exchange price and the final price, 

btcusd = {
	    "geminiBTCUSD_mid": (geminiBTCUSD_ask + geminiBTCUSD_bid) / 2,
	    "okcoinBTCUSD_mid": (okcoinBTCUSD_ask + okcoinBTCUSD_bid) / 2,
	    "bitfinexBTCUSD_mid": (bitfinexBTCUSD_ask + bitfinexBTCUSD_bid) / 2,
	    "btceBTCUSD_mid": (btceBTCUSD_ask + btceBTCUSD_bid) / 2,
	    "krakenBTCUSD_mid": (krakenBTCUSD_ask + krakenBTCUSD_bid) / 2,
	    "bitstampBTCUSD_mid": (bitstampBTCUSD_ask + bitstampBTCUSD_bid) / 2
	}

def get_BTCUSD(btcusd):

	usdpw_usdtotal = 0
	
	for price in btcusd.values():
		usdpw_usdtotal += price
	
	usdpw_BTCUSD = usdpw_usdtotal / len(btcusd)
	
	return usdpw_BTCUSD
